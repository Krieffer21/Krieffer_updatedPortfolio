## Professional Materials: Updating Portfolio
  This assignment was to update our existing portfolio to make it more employer ready. I decided to use my existing files and drasticlly change them with cleaner code and a better color scheme. 

## Portfolio Works
  The screenshot below shows that I can easily add new works to my portfolio by copying and pasting the section of code. So all I have to do is update info.
